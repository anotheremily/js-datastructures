js-datastructures
Zach Young <young.zach@gmail.com>

This package creates objects for stacks, queues, and deques; three common 
data structures. There is really no need for them as an Array will handle 
the same functionality, but it was an programming exercise in JavaScript 
objects and utilizing the ability for an object to partially inherit from 
different objects.
